            <h3>Paris, the city of love</h3>
            <p>
              The evolution of Parisian women in society has enabled the City of
              Light to go from the “European brothel” to the romantic city par
              excellence. Parisian women started to emancipate, and they also
              populated public places like cafés or restaurants. These women
              married for love, to men with whom they could live a passion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city, with its wide avenues, elegant buildings, and lovely
              parks, became a muse for many national and international artists.
              Therefore, all the romanticism and inspiration were somewhat shown
              in their works. The attraction of its food, its wine, its
              champagne, and the atmosphere on the café-terraces and the Belle
              Epoque brasseries makes Paris the perfect romantic destination of
              choice for lovers.
